The high-frequency MRI database
=======================================

The high-frequency MRI database is a repeated-measure study that collects
multiple microstructural MRI data with a high number of MRI acquisitions over
a short period of time in healthy subjects.
This dataset was designed to generate enough data per subject to optimize a
relevant assessment of the consistency of different brain MRI measurements.
