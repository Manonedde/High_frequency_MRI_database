Welcome to the High-frequency MRI database documentation
=========================================================

The high-frequency MRI database is a repeated-measure study that collects multiple
microstructural MRI data with a high number of MRI acquisitions over a short period
of time in healthy subjects. This dataset was designed to optimize a relevant
assessment of the consistency of different brain MRI measurements.

The tools described and used are developed by the Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab (`SCIL`_).
