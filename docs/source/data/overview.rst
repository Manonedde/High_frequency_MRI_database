Overview
========

The high-frequency MRI database is a repeated-measure study that collects
multiple microstructural MRI data:
    * anatomical (3DT1 and FLAIR)
    * multi-shell diffusion weighted images (DWI)
    * inhomogeneous MT images (ihMT)
with a high number of MRI acquisitions over a short period of time in healthy
subjects. This high-frequency dataset was designed to generate enough data per
subject to optimize a relevant assessment of the consistency of different brain
MRI measurements. The two aspects of consistency, reliability and variability,
were evaluated using the Intraclass Coefficient correlation (ICC) value and
within- and between-subject coefficient of variation (CV).


Acquisition scheme
------------------
Twenty healthy adults were scanned 5 times over 6 months at the Centre
Hospitalier Universitaire of Sherbrooke (CHUS) using a clinical 3T MRI scanner
(Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands).


Pipeline summary
----------------
The main steps of the analysis are summarized in the figure below.
