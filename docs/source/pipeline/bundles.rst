Bundles

Bundles segmentation
--------------------

- For the segmentation of bundles we used `Recobundles <https://github.com/scilus/rbx_flow>`__

Bundles profiling
--------------------

- For the profiling bundles we used `Tractometry flow  <https://github.com/scilus/tractometry_flow>`__

Bundles reproducibility
------------------------

To minimize the impact of the variability of reconstruction by tractography of the bundles on the measurements extracted from them, 
we evaluate the reproducibility as described in Rheault et al. 2022. 
Dice average value and correlation average of the density maps (voxels) from all pairwise combinations were used to provide an estimate of the 
agreement between segmentations of the same bundle across sessions.
