Correlation across measures and bundles
=======================================

Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to evaluate the covariance of the averaged diffusion measures for all bundles.
For each MRI measurements, Pearson correlations were computed for each session and then averaged across sessions to generate 
correlation map:

   * average for all sessions
   
   * for each session individually

To increase the contrast, the Pearson correlation coefficients are displayed in squared values.
